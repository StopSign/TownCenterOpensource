        You've got a long way to go before you find the Potion of Immortality
        that will let you survive in this harsh world where everyone wants you
        dead.  You'd better train yourself and build up some thick skin, so
        you won't get murdered on the way.  Type "upgrade" to access an
        upgrade menu where you can spend your microachievements to supercharge
        your body.
