        Life is full of ups and downs.  One day you're the king of the world,
        the next day, a stray dog is ripping your guts out with a chainsaw.
        There's no point whining and crying about it.  You'd better just suck
        it up.  Walk it off.  Move on.  The "suckitup" command can be used
        when you're incapacitated and getting torso'd by an enemy.  It will
        increase the rate at which your body naturally heals.  You'll probably
        have to "suckitup" repeatedly until your natural healing rate cancels
        out the rate at which the enemy is killing you.  Then you'll be able
        to jump back up onto your feet, greet the world with a smile, and face
        the next opponent who wants you dead!
