        <p>
            As you fight, every attack (by you or your enemy) gets added to
            your <dfn>combo</dfn>.  The longer and more unique your combo is,
            the more microachievements you get!
        </p>

        <p>
            Every attack, there's a risk of your combo resetting.  The higher
            your intelligence, the lower this risk becomes.
