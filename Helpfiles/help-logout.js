        Type "logout" to log out of your character.  We can certainly
        understand why you might want to escape after all, who would want to go
        on living in a world like this where literally every living creature
        wants you to drop down dead?

        <blockquote>
            Warning: If you're a brand new player and you logout without first
            setting your username and password, then your character will be
            lost for all time.  (Of course you can always make a new one.)
