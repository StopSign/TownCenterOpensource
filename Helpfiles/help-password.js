        <p>Not only is everyone trying you kill you, even worse, everyone is also
        trying to hack your account to steal all your progress.  You'd better
        choose a good password so you can give them the middle finger.  You
        wouldn't want all your hard-earned micro-achievements getting auctioned
        off on some Chinese hacker-forum, would you?</p>

        <p>
            Type "password" to access the password-changing menu where you can
            change your password.  Players who haven't set their name yet will
            need to set their name first, using the "name" command.
