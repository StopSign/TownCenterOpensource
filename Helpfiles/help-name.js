        <p>Most players wake up in Town Center with a horrible, degrading name
        etched into their skin.  This is pretty scary, until they realize they
        can remove the name with sheer willpower and gain another name.</p>

        <p>
            Choosing a name is one of the most important decisions a new player
            makes.  Choosing a name is what allows new players to save their
            progress so they won't los everything when they log out of the
            game.  Type "name" to access the name-changing menu.

        <p>
            You can only change your name once, so choose wisely.
