        Life is pretty miserable when literally every. single. living. thing.
        on. earth. wants. you. dead.  I can't blame you for thinking of suicide
        under such dire circumstances.  Well, if you want to do it, type
        "suicide".  That'll reduce your health to 1 HP, and your enemies will
        finish you off soon enough from there.
    </div>
