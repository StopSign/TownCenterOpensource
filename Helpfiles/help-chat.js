        The bad news is that everyone wants you dead.  The good news is you
        seem to have spontaneously developed telepathy.  You can use the
        "chat" command to chat with other players currently playing.  For
        example, if you wanted to chat "Hello world", you would type:{' '}
        <em>chat Hello world</em>.  Chat messages are visible to all the
        players currently playing Town Center.
