        The bad news is everyone wants you dead.  The good news is you
        seem to have spontaneously developed telepathy.  You can use the
        "chat" command to chat with other players.  For example, if you
        wanted to chat "Hello world", you would type: <em>chat Hello
        world</em>.  Chat messages are visible to all players currently
        playing Town Center.
