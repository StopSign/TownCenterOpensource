        Don't you hate it when you wake up in someone else's body?  It's bad
        enough that everyone's trying to kill you, it would be nice if they
        were at least courteous enough to kill you in your own familiar body!
        Fortunately there's a command for that.  Type "login" to access a form
        where you can log in using your username and password.  (You did set
        a username and password, didn't you...?)
    </div>
